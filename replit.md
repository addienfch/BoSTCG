- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for 3D assets
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Development Server**: Vite middleware integration
- **File Structure**: Monorepo with shared types and schemas

### 3D Game Engine
- **Rendering**: React Three Fiber with Drei helpers
- **Post-processing**: React Three Postprocessing
- **Asset Support**: GLTF/GLB models, GLSL shaders
- **Camera Controls**: Custom 3D card game perspective

## Key Components

### Game Systems
1. **Card Game Engine** (`/game/stores/useGameStore.ts`)
   - Turn-based gameplay with multiple phases (refresh, draw, main1, battle, damage, main2, end)
   - Avatar and action card mechanics
   - Energy system with elemental types (fire, water, ground, air, neutral)
   - Counter system for status effects (bleed, burn, freeze, poison, stun, shield)

2. **Deck Management** (`/game/stores/useDeckStore.ts`)
   - Deck builder with card filtering and validation
   - Card collection management
   - Integration with blockchain NFTs (cNFTs)

3. **AI System** 
   - Simple AI opponent for single-player mode
   - Conditional damage calculation system
   - Skill trigger checking and effect processing

### Blockchain Integration
- **Platform**: Solana blockchain
- **NFT Standard**: Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) for scalability
- **Wallet**: Phantom wallet integration
- **Services**: Card minting, trading, and ownership verification

### Card Types and Elements
- **Avatar Cards**: Creatures with health, skills, and tribal affiliations
- **Action Cards**: Spells, equipment, and utility cards
- **Elements**: Fire, Water, Ground, Air, Neutral
- **Tribes**: Kobar, Borah, Kuhaka, Kujana, Kuku

### Data Management
- **Card Data**: Comprehensive card database with metadata
- **Image Assets**: Organized texture system with fallback handling
- **Conditional Effects**: Advanced damage calculation with triggers
- **Booster Packs**: Gacha system for card acquisition

## Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**: Load player deck, shuffle cards, set initial game state
2. **Turn Management**: Phase progression with automated AI responses
3. **Card Actions**: Drag-and-drop interface for card placement and targeting
4. **Effect Resolution**: Skill triggers, damage calculation, and status updates
5. **State Synchronization**: Real-time updates across game components

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Port Configuration**: 5000 (local) â†’ 80 (external)
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite HMR with error overlay

### Production Deployment
- **Target**: Google Cloud Run
- **Build Process**: Client and server bundling with asset optimization
